Residential Life


An on-campus hostel facility provides students from far off places, especially those from other nations with a sense of safety and belongingness. But, the benefits of hostel life are not merely limited to acting as a shelter home. .



We remain plentifully pleased with hundreds of parents to have trusted our school as the best International Residential School in Karaikudi. A dorm parent has more of an invested role. We care for our children to such an extent that we treat them like our own. CVM boarding provides a unique structured home like experience that helps students become independent citizens. World class amenities and learning environment contributes tremendously on the overall development of our borders.</p>

Beginning in 2012, his investigation of complaints of illegal granite-mining in the Madurai area led to charges against a number of politicians and businesses, including a mining company founded by a scion of one of Madurai's most influential political families.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U._Sagayam"><b>For More info, Click here</b></a></p></div></div></div>
